Configuration of the operator's pod is done via environment variables at startup.

| NAME                                  | DEFAULT                | DESCRIPTION |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------- |
| `OPERATOR_NAMESPACE`                  | N/A                    | See [Install modes](#install-modes) |
| `OPERATOR_TARGET_NAMESPACES`          | N/A                    | See [Install modes](#install-modes) |
| `OPERATOR_LOG_DEV_MODE`               | `false`                | The flag to use (or not use) development mode (more human-readable output, extra stack traces and logging information, etc). |
| `OPERATOR_SCAN_JOB_TIMEOUT`           | `5m`                   | The length of time to wait before giving up on a scan job |
| `OPERATOR_CONCURRENT_SCAN_JOBS_LIMIT` | `3`                    | The maximum number of scan jobs create by the operator |
| `OPERATOR_SCAN_JOB_RETRY_AFTER`       | `30s`                  | The duration to wait before retrying a failed scan job |
| `OPERATOR_METRICS_BIND_ADDRESS`       | `:8080`                | The TCP address to bind to for serving [Prometheus][prometheus] metrics. It can be set to `0` to disable the metrics serving. |
| `OPERATOR_HEALTH_PROBE_BIND_ADDRESS`  | `:9090`                | The TCP address to bind to for serving health probes, i.e. `/healthz/` and `/readyz/` endpoints. |

## Install Modes

The values of the `OPERATOR_NAMESPACE` and `OPERATOR_TARGET_NAMESPACES` determine
the install mode, which in turn determines the multitenancy support of the operator.

| MODE            | OPERATOR_NAMESPACE | OPERATOR_TARGET_NAMESPACES | DESCRIPTION |
| --------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------- | ----------- |
| OwnNamespace    | `operators`        | `operators`                | The operator can be configured to watch events in the namespace it is deployed in. |
| SingleNamespace | `operators`        | `foo`                      | The operator can be configured to watch for events in a single namespace that the operator is not deployed in. |
| MultiNamespace  | `operators`        | `foo,bar,baz`              | The operator can be configured to watch for events in more than one namespace. |
| AllNamespaces   | `operators`        | (blank string)             | The operator can be configured to watch for events in all namespaces. |
